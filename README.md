# Hey, I'm Igor Kalen 👋

Certified IT freak who’s obsessed with servers and data centers - future data center technician in the making ;)
Started my building my brand in 2024, aiming to launch my own agency & hosting company by 2031.
I’m skilled in Linux, building websites, and creating graphic designs & branding that stand out.
Homelab game strong since 2023 — went from a Raspberry Pi to owning PowerEdge servers, UniFi gear, a rack, UPS… basically my own mini data centre.
